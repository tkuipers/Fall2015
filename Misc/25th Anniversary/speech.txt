25 years together, and your love for each other seems to only grow stronger. Who knew that you two would still be crazy in love for each other.  Even though I have only witnessed 22 of your 25 years together, I can honestly say that I am the luckiest son in the world because you both inspire me everyday. I stand here amazed by you two. You both gave me life but you also taught me how to be the best person I can be. 

I know for a fact that I would not be where I am today if it weren’t for you two. I can thank both of you over and over again for giving me everything that you have given me but I can’t truly thank you enough for being two people that I can model my life after.  You are consistently the two people I look up to and aspire to be.

there were so many times that you did things for us that went without recognition or even a simple thanks.  I would like to thank you now for the things that you did which helped raise our family into what it is today./

Mom, I'd like to thank you for always having my back.  You are always there for me when I need a shoulder to lean on.  You constantly remind me what it truely means to be loyal.  You are always there for a friend in need, and are willing to drop everything if a friend needs it.

Dad, thank you for teaching me the true meaning of hard work.  You are the hardest working person I know and your accomplishments in life never cease to amaze me.  you always went the extra mile for everyone around you and the communities you become a part of are better for it.

I know I can speak for all of us kids when I say that you have taught all of us that marriage is more than a relationship, it is the perfect balance of a partnership between 2 people who would sacrifice their own lives for the other while also being best friends on top of all that. Having parents who are still so in love with each other after 25 years, is something rare and I hope you both know how deeply appreciative I am to have been raised by you both.
